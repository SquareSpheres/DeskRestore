# DeskRestore

Some code written for Windows that allows one to "snapshot" the desktop(all open applications). The snapshot saves size, position, and state, which can be recovered later by restoring the snapshot.

## TODO

- fix bug (z-order might be wrong)
- write tests
- rewrite AppState and DesktopState
  - struct to class
  - missing constructors
  - non const members
  - ...
